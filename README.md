# 🚢 Titanic Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and survival prediction on the Titanic dataset using Python, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning.**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes the **Titanic passenger dataset** to uncover patterns and build predictive models for survival using machine learning.  
The work includes:
- Extensive **exploratory data analysis**
- **Data cleaning** and **feature engineering**
- Training **classification models** (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)
- Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset is canonically sourced from the Titanic Kaggle competition and is widely used in EDA and ML practice.  
Key features include:
- Passenger demographics: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`
- Family structure: `SibSp`, `Parch`
- Financial features: `Fare`
- Port of embarkation: `Embarked`
- Label: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.  
Typical analyses include:
- Distribution of variables: age, fare, survival rates
- Relationship plots: survival by gender, passenger class, age group
- Correlation analysis and missing value exploration
- Identifying outliers and feature relationships

---

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

Enables model-readiness through:
- Handling missing values (`Age`, `Cabin`)
- Encoding categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Creating new features (e.g., family size, title extraction from names)
- Scaling and normalization as needed

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Models implemented may include:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Network (optional)

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Confusion matrix** for detailed classification insights

## 🧾 Results & Findings

- Gender and passenger class are highly correlated with survival.
- Children and females had higher survival rates.
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression models achieved ~80-85% accuracy.
- Visualizations illustrate survival distribution across different features.
